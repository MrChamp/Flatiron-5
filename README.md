## Getting Started
<p>The files are in the .ipynb format and were made in Jupyter Lab using the dark theme; so color schemes may be difficult to see on lighter themed environments.</br></br>

The "main.ipynb" file is the focus of the project - it is a data science notebook exploring the previously collected options data set.</br></br>
